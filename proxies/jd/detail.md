# JD

I'm thankful for your consideration. I go by JD (cryptojd) on Discord and JD [on X](https://x.com/0x41nullbody).

# Experience

I am an active member of the Mobile Working Group and a Helium Foundation Steering Member. I always listen to community feedback before casting votes and consistently voice community concerns. I work diligently with the community to address these concerns and have contributed feedback to the development of numerous HIPs (Helium Improvement Proposals).

## Voting Philosophy

My voting philosophy centers on ensuring the network's future growth and success. I consider current growth trends and focus on optimizing radio deployments while addressing community concerns. I strive to develop solutions to ongoing problems and provide anti-cheating measures to maintain the network's integrity. Using me as a voting proxy is a strategic long-term decision aimed at fostering a prosperous future for the network. I will hold community calls [on X](https://x.com/MokenMarket) every Thursday at 1 PM EST for those who use me as a voting proxy to voice thoughts and concerns about active and future HIPs.
